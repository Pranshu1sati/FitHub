<p>Our group project is an exercise and yoga web application that incorporates pose detection technology to help users perfect their form and prevent injuries. The aim of the app is to create a seamless and interactive experience that encourages individuals to make exercise and yoga a regular part of their lives.

    Our team consists of Pranshu and myself, who are responsible for the backend development, and Ishu and Anshika, who have been working on the frontend of the application. With our combined skills and expertise, we have been able to create a user-friendly and effective platform that caters to the needs of both beginners and advanced practitioners.
    
    One of the key features of our application is the use of pose detection technology, which allows users to receive real-time feedback on their form and alignment. This is particularly useful for those who may not have access to a personal trainer or instructor, as it helps to reduce the risk of injury and ensures that each pose is performed correctly.
    
    In addition to the pose detection feature, our application also includes a range of pre-recorded exercise and yoga classes, as well as the ability to customize and create personalized routines. Users can track their progress, set goals, and receive reminders to ensure that they stay on track with their fitness journey.
    
    Overall, our exercise and yoga web application is designed to make fitness and wellness accessible to everyone, regardless of their experience level or background. We are proud of the work that we have done and are excited to continue improving and enhancing our platform in the future.</p>
<p> Our fitness web app project is focused on creating a platform that helps people track their fitness progress, set goals, and connect with others in the fitness community. We noticed that many people struggle to stay motivated and accountable when it comes to fitness, and we wanted to create a platform that would help them stay on track.
    
    To achieve this, we are developing a web app that includes features such as personalized workout plans, a nutrition tracker, progress tracking, and a social component that allows users to connect with others in the fitness community. Our goal is to create an all-in-one platform that makes it easy for people to achieve their fitness goals and stay motivated.
    
    We are currently in the development phase of the project, and each of us has taken on specific roles to ensure its success. I am responsible for the web app's design and user interface, Pranshu is in charge of the app's backend development, Ishu is handling the app's front-end development, and Pranshu and me are responsible for overseeing the project and ensuring that everything is on track.
    
    We have completed the initial design phase and have started working on the development of the app's core features. We are currently integrating the nutrition tracker and workout plan features and are testing them with a small group of users to gather feedback and make improvements.
    
    As we move forward, we are excited about the potential of our fitness web app project and the impact it could have on people's lives. We believe that our app could help many people achieve their fitness goals and lead healthier, happier lives.
    
    In conclusion, staying fit and healthy is essential for a happy life, and we are working on a fitness web app project that aims to make it easier for people to achieve their fitness goals. We are committed to creating an all-in-one platform that includes personalized workout plans, nutrition tracking, progress tracking, and a social component that connects users with others in the fitness community. We are excited about the potential of our project and look forward to its completion.
